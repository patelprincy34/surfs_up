### Overview of SurfsUp Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to look at temperature data between June and December to determine if having a surf shop year-round is feasible. The temperature data is obtained by doing two separate queries, one for June and the other for December.

### Results
* For June the mean temperature was 75°F, min temperature was 64°F and max temperature was 85°F.

### Summary
We can identify what our temperature are based on our data, but because weather has other aspects like as precipitation, we may need to run extra queries to determine whether or not customers can visit the shop thought the year. We can perform even more queries if we can get additional data for the area. From there, we can select how we want to construct the business and what sections will make it a more visible destination for tourists.
